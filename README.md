# gpio_MCP23S17
A complete library for Microchip MCP23S17, a 16 port I/O GPIO with Interrupt and HAEN that let you use 8 chip (16*8) by using just 3 (or 4 if you need input) CPU pins!<br>
The library it's fully SPI transaction compatible and can be easily included in other libraries, has methods that let's you change ports values fastly and you can easily access chip register directly.<br>
This library has been extracted from my universal gpio_library and I will maintain separately.
